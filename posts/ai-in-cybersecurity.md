# The Synergy of AI and Cybersecurity in Modern Defense Strategies

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity has emerged as a game-changing paradigm. This synergy is reshaping how organizations approach threat detection, prevention, and response. Let's delve into the key areas where AI is making a significant impact in the cybersecurity domain.

## AI-Powered Threat Detection

One of the most prominent applications of AI in cybersecurity is in threat detection. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, identifying patterns and anomalies that might indicate a security breach. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, AI can adapt to new types of attacks, making it a formidable tool in the cybersecurity arsenal.

\`\`\`python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example code snippet for a simple AI-based anomaly detection model
def build_anomaly_detection_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Train the model on your security log data
# X: features, y: labels (0 for normal, 1 for anomaly)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = build_anomaly_detection_model(X_train.shape[1:])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
